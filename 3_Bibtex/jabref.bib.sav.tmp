  abstract = {It is shown that in certain types of dynamical systems it is possible to have attractors which are strange but not chaotic. Here we use the word strange to refer to the geometry or shape of the attracting set, while the word chaotic refers to the dynamics of orbits on the attractor (in particular, the exponential divergence of nearby trajectories). We first give examples for which it can be demonstrated that there is a strange nonchaotic attractor. These examples apply to a class of maps which model nonlinear oscillators (continuous time) which are externally driven at two incommensurate frequencies. It is then shown that such attractore are persistent under perturbations which preserve the original system type (i.e., there are two incommensurate external driving frequencies). This suggests that, for systems of the typw which we have considered, nonchaotic strange attractors may be expected to occur for a finite interval of parameter values. On the other hand, when small perturbations which do not preserve the system type are numerically introduced the strange nonchaotic attractor is observed to be converted to a periodic or chaotic orbit. Thus we conjecture that, in general, continuous time systems (“flows”) which are not externally driven at two incommensurate frequencies should not be expected to have strange nonchaotic attractors except possibly on a set of measure zero in the parameter space.},

  abstract  = {The only implicit smoothing method implemented in the DLR Flow Solver TAU is the LU-SGS method. It was chosen several years ago because of its low memory requirements and low operation counts. Since in the past for many examples a severe restriction of the CFL number and loss of robustness was observed, it is the goal of this paper to revisit the LU-SGS implementation and to discuss several alternative implicit smoothing strategies used within an agglomeration multigrid for unstructured meshes. Starting point is a full implicit multistage Runge-Kutta method. Based on this method we develop and suggest several additional features and simplifications such that the implicit method is applicable to high Reynolds number viscous flows, that is the required matrices fit into the fast memory of our cluster hardware and the arising linear systems can be approximately solved efficiently. To this end we focus on simplifications of the Jacobian as well as efficient iterative approximate solution methods. To significantly improve the approximate linear solution methods we take care of grid anisotropy for both approximately solving the linear systems and agglomeration strategy. The procedure creating coarse grid meshes is extended by strategies identifying structured parts of the mesh. This seems to improve the quality of coarse grid meshes in the way that an overall better reliability of multigrid can be observed. Furthermore we exploit grid information within the iterative solution methods for the linear systems. Numerical examples demonstrate the gain with respect to reliability and efficiency.},

  abstract = {AdaBoost is one of the most excellent Boosting algorithms. It has a solid theoretical basis and has made great success in practical applications. AdaBoost can boost a weak learning algorithm with an accuracy slightly better than random guessing into an arbitrarily accurate strong learning algorithm, bringing about a new method and a new design idea to the design of learning algorithm. This paper first introduces how Boosting, just a conjecture when proposed, was proved right, and how this proof led to the origin of AdaBoost algorithm. Second, training and generalization error of AdaBoost are analyzed to explain why AdaBoost can successfully improve the accuracy of a weak learning algorithm. Third, different theoretical models to analyze AdaBoost are given. Meanwhile, many variants derived from these models are presented. Fourth, extensions of binary-class AdaBoost to multiclass AdaBoost are described. Besides, applications of AdaBoost algorithm are also introduced. Finally, interested directions which need to be further studied are discussed. For Boosting theory, these directions include deducing a tighter generalization error bound and finding a more precise weak learning condition in multiclass problem. For AdaBoost, the stopping conditions, the way to enhance anti-noise capability and how to improve the accuracy by optimizing the diversity of the base classifiers, are good questions to be in-depth researched.},

  abstract  = {This leading textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. This is the first machine learning textbook to include a comprehensive coverage of recent developments such as probabilistic graphical models and deterministic inference methods, and to emphasize a modern Bayesian perspective. It is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. This hard cover book has 738 pages in full colour, and there are 431 graded exercises.

Solutions for these exercises and extensive support for course instructors are provided on Christopher Bishop's page.

Now available to download in full as a PDF.},
