## Thesis Overview

This master thesis focuses on developing a data-driven modeling technique for predicting the behavior of general dynamic systems, particularly aimed at complex fluid dynamics problems. The work contributes to the fields of fluid mechanics, machine learning, and computational modeling.

## Key Achievements

* Developed an improved version of control-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling (CNMc) for predicting trajectories of general dynamical systems
* Removed key limitations of the previous CNMc version, enabling application to any general dynamical system regardless of dimensionality or trajectory shape
* Implemented 10 different dynamical systems by default to demonstrate CNMc's broad applicability
* Replaced computationally expensive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with faster Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for modal decomposition, reducing runtime from hours to seconds
* Wrote CNMc from scratch in a modular way to allow easy integration with existing code and straightforward replacement of algorithms
* Developed a flexible configuration system allowing all important parameters to be adjusted via a single settings file
* Implemented post-processing features including HTML plot generation with interactive capabilities for in-depth visual analysis
* Added functionality to execute multiple dynamical models sequentially and selectively enable/disable CNMc steps
* Demonstrated CNMc's ability to capture and predict behavior of complex nonlinear and chaotic dynamical systems
* Removed interpolation errors by replacing B-spline with linear interpolation, enabling appropriate visualization of predicted trajectories

## Compilation Note

This project uses TikZ diagrams generated with pyxdsm. To compile the thesis correctly, you need to:

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it
2. Install pyxdsm: `pip install pyxdsm`
3. Locate the `diagram_styles.tex` file:
   ```
   find /path/to/your/virtualenv -name diagram_styles.tex
   ```
4. Replace the following line in the relevant .tex files:
    ```
    \input{/home/jav/Progs/Virt_Env/writing/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pyxdsm/diagram_styles.tex}
    ```
with the actual path to the `diagram_styles.tex` file on your system.

For the initial build process, you may need to run the following sequence:

1. pdflatex
2. makeglossaries
3. pdflatex
4. pdflatex

## Important Notes

1. The PDF file (`main.pdf`) in the root directory is the original, unmodified version as submitted. The version uploaded here is a snapshot of what was submitted back then. Mistakes found post-submission have not been corrected. The reason for the latter is: the goal is to authentically show the original state that contains mistakes. Editing these mistakes afterwards would pretend to have had knowledge that I did not possess back then. All in all, it shall show that I am human, I made mistakes back then, am doing them now and will make them in upcoming projects. Inshallah I will learn from them. Acknowledging my mistakes is something I learned from the Quran and I think it is a good practice to stay honest.
2. This repository can be used as a template for your projects.

## Note on README Creation

This README was created with the assistance of an AI large language model, specifically the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. While the content accurately reflects the thesis and repository structure, the wording and organization were enhanced through AI collaboration.
