Thank you, Dr. Semaan - you provided me with the possibility to work on such a compelling and challenging topic. Even though the difficult tasks were not always pleasant, I very much appreciate the opportunity to have worked on these captivating tasks. 
Thank you for the time and effort you invested in this work.
Also, thank you for the weekly English exercises and for explaining to me how to pronounce methodology correctly :D
